The dog sat on the dog mat beside the dog bowl, watching another dog chase a dog toy across the dog-colored carpet.
Each dog seemed to enjoy being a dog in a world full of dog things, living the perfect dog life.
Even the sunlight filtering through the window seemed to favor the dog, casting a golden glow on the content little dog nap. One dog stretched lazily, arching its dog back in that graceful, dog-like way before hopping onto a dog perch near the dog tree. A third dog peeked out from a cardboard dog box, its dog eyes gleaming with curiosity as it plotted a sneak attack on the unsuspecting dog still batting the dog toy.
In this house, every corner had something dog-relatedâ€”a dog cushion here, a dog scratching post there, and even a wall filled with framed dog photos.
It was, without a doubt, a dog's world, and every dog in it was perfectly, proudly, and peacefully... a dog.
