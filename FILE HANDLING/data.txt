The cat sat on the cat mat beside the cat bowl, watching another cat chase a cat toy across the cat-colored carpet.
Each cat seemed to enjoy being a cat in a world full of cat things, living the perfect cat life.
Even the sunlight filtering through the window seemed to favor the cat, casting a golden glow on the content little cat nap. One cat stretched lazily, arching its cat back in that graceful, cat-like way before hopping onto a cat perch near the cat tree. A third cat peeked out from a cardboard cat box, its cat eyes gleaming with curiosity as it plotted a sneak attack on the unsuspecting cat still batting the cat toy.
In this house, every corner had something cat-relatedâ€”a cat cushion here, a cat scratching post there, and even a wall filled with framed cat photos.
It was, without a doubt, a cat's world, and every cat in it was perfectly, proudly, and peacefully... a cat.
